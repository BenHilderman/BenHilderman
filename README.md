### What I build
I ship production style software with a reliability mindset. Clean code, automated tests, and CI pipelines that teams can trust.

Core engineering focus  
• Backend development in Java with Spring Boot services, Hibernate, PostgreSQL, SQL and DDL  
• Full stack delivery with Angular for UI features and integrations  
• CI CD with Jenkins and Git workflows, PR validation, release blocking gates, and regression automation  
• Test automation across unit, integration, UI, and performance using Spring Test, Mockito, Angular TestBed, Jasmine, and Playwright  
• Debugging and stabilizing CI on Linux by tracing issues through logs and telemetry and improving determinism
